A professional-grade **B2B SaaS Revenue Engine Simulator** built for Analytics Engineers
who help A-series startups make data-driven decisions or prepare for their B-series raise.

This tool populates every layer of a real A-series tech stack with high-fidelity,
cross-referenced sandbox data — from the first paid ad click to the closed deal call transcript.

## 📖 The "ScaleFlow" Use Case (Why this exists)

Imagine **ScaleFlow**, a promising A-Series SaaS. They spend $50k/mo on Meta Ads, their HubSpot is full of leads, but their conversion rate is terrible and churn is spiking. 

**The Analytics Problem (The Blank Space):**
*   **Sales says:** "We lost the deal because the price is too high." (Recorded in HubSpot).
*   **Product says:** "Users are logging in, so they must be active." (Recorded in PostHog).
*   **Support says:** "Ticket volume is up." (Recorded in Freshdesk).

**The Solution (This Engine):**
By orchestrating this 7-layer data pipeline, an Analytics Engineer can build a `Customer 360` view that reveals the *real* story:
1.  **Sales Intelligence (Layer 7):** Call transcripts reveal the deal wasn't lost on price; it was stalled because ScaleFlow lacks a **Jira Integration**.
2.  **Product / Support Correlation (Layers 4 & 5):** The churnspike isn't random. PostHog shows users hitting an `export_failed_error`, and Freshdesk shows urgent tickets about "Reports timing out."

*This script doesn't just generate random data. It generates these exact correlating business patterns across 7 different platforms so you can practice building the queries that solve them.*

## 🔑 Stack Decisions (with rationale)

| Tool | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| **HubSpot** | ✅ Kept | Standard CRM at A-series (Salesforce comes at B-series when ACV > $30k) |
| **Stripe** | ✅ Kept | Default billing for SaaS; generates richest revenue time-series data |
| **PostHog** | ✅ Kept | Open-source friendly, unique session/onboarding/feature-depth events not in Supabase |
| **Freshdesk** | ✅ Kept | Support layer for health scoring (ticket volume vs MRR) |
| **Supabase** | ✅ Kept | Product DB + warehouse (dim_date, SCD-ready, dbt-compatible) |
| **Meta Ads** | ✅ Kept | Demand generation + attribution layer |
| **Call Transcripts** | ✅ New | The "why we won/lost" layer — missing from most RevOps setups |
| **Mixpanel** | ❌ Removed | 80% overlap with Supabase events; PostHog covers unique analytics needs |
| **Salesforce** | ❌ Not added | A-series standard is HubSpot; Salesforce is a B-series migration signal |

## 💡 What Makes This Different

### 1. Cross-Referenced Data (Layer 2 → Layer 7)
HubSpot deal IDs are captured during the CRM write and injected into call transcript
records — so you can do real attribution analysis: `call outcome → deal closed?`

### 2. Sales Intelligence Layer (New)
Most RevOps pipelines stop at CRM + Stripe. This simulator adds a `call_transcripts`
table to Supabase with structured fields extracted from synthetic transcripts:

```
call_type       → discovery | demo | follow_up | negotiation | closing
outcome         → moved_to_demo | closed_won | stalled | budget_concern
objection_raised→ "pricing is too high" | "not the right time" ...
buying_signal   → "can we talk enterprise pricing?" | "how fast can we start?" ...
hubspot_deal_id → cross-reference to CRM deal
transcript      → full synthetic conversation
```

### 3. Warehouse-Ready from Day 1
Supabase includes a full `dim_date` calendar dimension — every time-series
dbt model can join it without extra setup.

### 4. SCD Type 2 Ready
HubSpot deal progressions and Supabase company status updates generate
real deltas on every run — perfect for testing dbt snapshots.

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Initialize Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure `.env`
Copy `.env.example` and fill in your sandbox credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:

| Service | Variables |
|---------|-----------|
| HubSpot | `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` |
| Stripe | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` |
| Supabase | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` |
| PostHog | `POSTHOG_API_KEY` |
| Freshdesk | `FRESHDESK_DOMAIN`, `FRESHDESK_API_KEY` |
| Meta Ads | `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_ACCOUNT_ID` (+ pixel for events) |

### 3. Supabase — First-Run Table Setup
Run the DDL below once in your **Supabase SQL Editor** before the first run:

```sql
-- Core tables (companies, users, events, subscriptions, dim_date)
-- Defined in integrations/supabase_writer.py → create_tables()

-- Sales intelligence layer (Layer 7)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS call_transcripts (
    id                UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    call_type         TEXT NOT NULL,
    deal_stage        TEXT,
    outcome           TEXT,
    rep_name          TEXT NOT NULL,
    rep_email         TEXT,
    prospect_company  TEXT NOT NULL,
    duration_minutes  INTEGER,
    call_date         TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    transcript        TEXT,
    objection_raised  TEXT,
    buying_signal     TEXT,
    next_step         TEXT,
    hubspot_deal_id   TEXT,
    created_at        TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## ▶️ Running the Engine

```bash
# Run the full 7-layer Revenue Engine
python main_revops_writer.py --all

# Run specific layers only
python main_revops_writer.py --services hubspot stripe posthog

# Include Meta Ads conversion events (requires pixel ID)
python main_revops_writer.py --all --meta-pixel-id YOUR_PIXEL_ID

# Check which layers are configured
python main_revops_writer.py --check-config

# Simulate without writing (dry run)
python main_revops_writer.py --dry-run
```

Expected output:
```
✓ META ADS        → 50 conversion events
✓ HUBSPOT         → 15 contacts, 8 companies, 12 deals
✓ STRIPE          → 15 customers, subscriptions, invoices
✓ POSTHOG         → sessions, onboarding, feature events
✓ FRESHDESK       → 25 support tickets
✓ SUPABASE        → 40 companies, users, events, dim_date
✓ CALL_TRANSCRIPTS→ 30 discovery/demo/closing call records
```
