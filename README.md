A professional-grade **B2B SaaS Revenue Engine Simulator** built for Analytics Engineers and Data Professionals who help A-series startups make data-driven decisions.

This tool populates every layer of a real A-series tech stack with high-fidelity, cross-referenced sandbox data — from the first paid ad click to the closed deal call transcript.

## 🔗 How Everything Connects (The Data Flow)

To make realistic analytics possible, data must connect seamlessly across platforms. Here is how our 7 layers talk to each other to create the perfect data warehouse dataset.

### 🎯 1. Where do the Leads come from? (Meta Ads -> PostHog)
When a prospect sees an ad, **Meta Ads** generates a `Lead` conversion event. Simultaneously, **PostHog** records a `User Signed Up` event tracked with a `paid_ad` source. *You can exactly map advertising spend to product signups.*

### 📋 2. How does the CRM work? (HubSpot)
That same user is pushed to **HubSpot** via their `company_domain`. A new Company, Contact, and Deal is created. As the prospect explores the product, Sales moves the deal through lifecycle stages (e.g., `presentationscheduled` -> `closedwon`).

### 💳 3. How are Payments connected? (Stripe)
When the HubSpot deal is marked `closedwon`, **Stripe** kicks in. It creates a Stripe Customer, a recurring Subscription tier, and generates up to 12 months of monthly historical Invoices. *This ties CRM efforts directly to MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue).*

### 📊 4. Product Health & Support (PostHog -> Freshdesk)
What if the product breaks? If **PostHog** detects that a company is experiencing high latency or `export_failed_error` events, the engine automatically triggers **Freshdesk** to generate URGENT support tickets from the same user. *This allows you to measure how product bugs influence churn.*

### 🗄️ 5. The Underlying Core (Supabase)
All these layers rest on a **Supabase** Postgres database. It stores the core application states (`users`, `companies`) and the groundbreaking **Layer 7**: Sales Intelligence. If a deal is lost, Supabase generates Gong-style Call Transcripts identifying exactly what objections killed the deal (e.g., "Missing Jira Integration").

## 💡 What Makes This Different

### 1. Cross-Referenced Data (No Blind Datasets)
Most simulators generate random lists. We use a shared `SimulationContext`. "TechFlow Solutions" in HubSpot has the exact same email domains, company priorities, and histories in Stripe and PostHog. You can build real Joins.

### 2. Sales Intelligence Layer (Layer 7)
Most RevOps pipelines stop at CRM + Stripe. This simulator adds a `call_transcripts` table to Supabase with structured fields extracted from synthetic transcripts:
```text
outcome          → moved_to_demo | closed_won | stalled
objection_raised → "pricing is too high" | "need jira integration"
hubspot_deal_id  → cross-reference to CRM deal
```

### 3. SCD Type 2 & Warehouse Ready
Supabase includes a full `dim_date` calendar dimension. HubSpot deal progressions generate real deltas on every run — perfect for testing `dbt snapshots` and time-series joined modeling.

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Local Installation

### 1. Initialize Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Credentials
Copy `.env.example` and fill in your sandbox credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*(Requires: HubSpot Token, Stripe Secret, PostHog Key, Freshdesk API, Supabase URL/Key, and Meta Ads Token).*

### 3. Initialize Supabase Data
Run the core DDL found in `integrations/supabase_writer.py` -> `create_tables()` inside your Supabase SQL Editor before the very first script run to create your schemas.

## 🏗️ Architecture — The Hybrid Model

This simulator operates on a **Hybrid Architecture** combining real-time user actions with background operations:

### 1. Real-Time Event Gateway (`app.py`)
A live Flask backend serving the frontend (Landing Page, Onboarding, Dashboard). It processes real-time user intent:
*   **Signups:** Generates HubSpot Contacts + Meta Leads instantly.
*   **Stripe Checkout:** Handles the "Upgrade" clicks, dynamically creating real Stripe checkout sessions based on the selected plan (Starter/Pro).
*   **Support & Telemetry:** Wires dashboard "Help" buttons directly to Freshdesk and generic actions to PostHog.

### 2. Daily Operations Batch (`main_revops_writer.py`)
The background engine. Real businesses don't just have signups; they have monthly billing cycles, background usage, and churn. This script runs daily to generate:
*   Historical Stripe Invoices (payments, retries, failures).
*   PostHog feature usage (or errors predicting churn).
*   Sales Intelligence transcripts into Supabase.

Both systems use the **exact same** configuration (`config.py`) and integrations, meaning data is perfectly synchronized.

## 📊 Data Model & Schema (The Analytics Blueprints)

To build a professional **MRR Waterfall** or **Multi-touch Attribution** model, you need specific fields. Here is the exact data structure this engine generates across your sandbox:

### 📋 1. HubSpot (CRM + Marketing Automation)
We don't just create names; we populate the deep metadata required for Lead Scoring and Funnel Velocity models:
*   **Identity:** `email`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `jobtitle`, `company_domain`.
*   **Marketing Automation:** 
    *   `hubspotscore`: Synthetic lead score (0-100) based on persona behavior.
    *   `hs_email_open`, `hs_email_click`: Email engagement tracking.
    *   `hs_analytics_source`: UTM Source (Google, LinkedIn, etc.) for attribution.
    *   `num_conversion_events`: Number of form submissions or whitepaper downloads.
*   **Sales Pipeline:** `lifecyclestage` (MQL -> SQL -> Opp), `dealstage`, `amount`.

### 💳 2. Stripe (Subscription Billing)
Structured to allow for Cohort Analysis and Churn prediction:
*   **Customers:** Metadata includes the `hubspot_company_id` for cross-platform joins.
*   **Subscriptions:** Tracks `plan_name` (Starter/Pro/Enterprise), `status` (active/past_due/canceled), and `billing_cycle`.
*   **Invoices:** Up to 12 months of historical invoices with `subtotal`, `tax`, and `paid` status.

### 📊 3. PostHog (Product Analytics)
Simulates "Sticky" product behavior vs "Churn" signals:
*   **Funnel Events:** `pageview` -> `user_signed_up` -> `onboarding_completed`.
*   **Feature Usage:** `feature_used` events with properties like `feature_name` (e.g., "Auto-Remediation") and `duration_seconds`.
*   **Health Signals:** High-frequency `latency_alert` or `export_failed_error` events for companies in the `at_risk` persona.

### 🗄️ 4. Supabase (The Golden Layer)
The primary source for your **Sales Intelligence** and DWH-ready facts:
*   **`call_transcripts`:** Gong-style records with `outcome` (closed_won/lost), `objection_raised` (e.g., "Missing GCP scan"), and `buying_signal`.
*   **`dim_date`:** A full calendar dimension (2 years back, 1 year forward) used for all time-series dbt joins.
*   **`events`:** A unified product event log mirroring the PostHog stream for internal SQL analysis.

## ▶️ Running the Engine

### Option A: The Real-Time Gateway (Interactive UI)
```bash
python3 app/app.py
```
*Go to `http://localhost:5050` to experience the live landing page, onboarding wizard, and interactive dashboard.*

### Option B: The Daily Batch Generator
```bash
# Run the full 7-layer Revenue Engine
python3 main_revops_writer.py --all

# Run specific layers only
python3 main_revops_writer.py --services hubspot stripe posthog

# Simulate without writing (dry run)
python3 main_revops_writer.py --dry-run
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ META ADS        → 50 conversion events
✓ HUBSPOT         → 15 contacts, 8 companies, 12 deals
✓ STRIPE          → 15 customers, subscriptions, invoices
✓ POSTHOG         → sessions, onboarding, feature events
✓ FRESHDESK       → 25 support tickets
✓ SUPABASE        → 40 companies, users, events, dim_date
✓ CALL_TRANSCRIPTS→ 30 discovery/demo/closing call records
```

## 🚀 Deployment & Safety

### Where to deploy?
If you want to host this live as a portfolio piece to show employers/clients:
1. **Render.com or Railway.app** — Perfect for hosting the `app.py` Flask server. Just set the `Start Command` to `gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app.app:app`.
2. **GitHub Actions** — Perfect for hosting the `main_revops_writer.py` daily batch job using cron.

### Is it safe?
> [!WARNING]
> **This is safe ONLY if you strictly use Sandbox/Test API keys.**
> If deployed publicly, anyone who fills out the landing page form will create a record in your CRM. If you use a real HubSpot or Stripe account, you will generate massive amounts of junk data and potentially real charges.
> **Recommendation:** Keep your `.env` variables securely in your hosting provider's Secrets manager and double-check that every key says `test` or `sandbox`.

**Built for Revenue. Designed for Scale. 🚀**
